            <p><j>At the top of a long page you might want to add a list of contents that links to the corresponding sections lower down. Or you might want to add a link from part way down the page back to the top of it to save users from having to scroll back to the top.</j>

                Before you can link to a specific
part of a page, you need to
identify the points in the page
that the link will go to. You do
this using the id attribute (which
can be used on every HTML
element). You can see that the
elements in this
example have been given id
attributes that identify
            </p>
        </p>
        <p id = "Bottom" style = "text-align:justify">
            To link to an element that uses
an id attribute you use the 
element again, but the value of
the href attribute starts with
the # symbol, followed by the
value of the id attribute of the
element you want to link to. In
this example, 
links to the  element at
the top of the page whose id
attribute has a value of top .
