## CSS

A simple css code looks like:

`p{font-family: Arial;}`

Here _p_ is a __selector__ and `font-family: Arial;` is a __declaration__.
Mulitple elements can be customized like this: 
```css
h1, h2, h3 {
    font-family: Arial;
    color: yellow;`
    }
```
`font-family:` and `color:` are **properties** and `Arial;` and `yello;` are __values__.


### Learned
1. Must use external style sheets.
